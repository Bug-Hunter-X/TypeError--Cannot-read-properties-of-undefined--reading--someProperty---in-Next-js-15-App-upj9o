# Next.js 15 App - TypeError Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in a Next.js 15 application.  When navigating between routes using the new `next/navigation` API, a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'someProperty')` error occurs on the client-side.

The bug is related to accessing properties of an object that might not be fully hydrated on the client-side before the component attempts to access it.  This is a common issue when dealing with asynchronous data fetching and client-side navigation. 

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate between different routes.
5. Observe the error in the browser's console.

## Bug Solution

The solution involves carefully managing the timing of data fetching and component rendering to ensure that the data is available before it's accessed. Proper usage of suspense, error boundaries, or conditional rendering can prevent this type of error.
